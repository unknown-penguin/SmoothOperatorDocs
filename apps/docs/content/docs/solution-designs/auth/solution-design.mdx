## Purpose

Provide secure authentication for users and services, enforce fine-grained authorization (RBAC), and manage token lifecycles for both HTTP APIs and realtime channels.

## Owners

- Product Manager: Valerii Tsyhanok
- Team: Platform Core (AUTH)

## Scope

### In Scope

- Username/password and SSO login
- Access/Refresh token issuance and rotation
- RBAC validation for APIs and realtime streams
- Token refresh and re-authentication for WebSocket sessions

### Out of Scope

- Federation across external IdPs beyond configured SSO
- Legacy API key auth (deprecated)

## High-level Flows

### Login & Token Issuance

<Diagram lang="plantuml" path="telemetry-sequence-read-model.puml" />

Notes:
- Uses bearer JWT with short TTL; refresh token for renewal.
- RBAC validated by Auth service for protected resources.

### Token Refresh & Realtime Auth

<Diagram lang="plantuml" path="telemetry-sequence-auth-refresh.puml" />

Notes:
- Re-authenticate realtime connection on token expiry without dropping subscriptions where possible.

## API Security Considerations

- Rotate signing keys regularly, maintain JWKS endpoint and caching.
- Use audience and issuer checks in all services.
- Scope tokens narrowly; prefer per-service audiences.
- Enforce HTTPS/TLS everywhere; mTLS for internal sensitive hops if required.

## Operational Concerns

- Rate-limit login and refresh endpoints.
- Alert on anomalous refresh patterns; invalidate refresh tokens on compromise.
- Provide self-service session revocation.
