# F1 Telemetry Platform — Domain Glossary

Comprehensive reference for domain terminology used throughout the F1 Telemetry Platform.

---

## Car Systems & Power Unit

### Power Unit (PU)
The complete F1 engine system: internal combustion engine + hybrid systems (ERS).

### ICE (Internal Combustion Engine)
The petrol engine component of the power unit.

### ERS (Energy Recovery System)
Hybrid system that recovers energy under braking and exhaust heat, then deploys it for extra power.

### MGU-K (Motor Generator Unit – Kinetic)
Recovers kinetic energy during braking and returns it as electrical power.

### MGU-H (Motor Generator Unit – Heat)
Recovers heat energy from the turbocharger.

### Turbocharger
Compresses air into the engine to increase power output.

### Fuel Flow
Liters per hour moving through the power unit; governed by strict FIA regulations.

### Throttle Position
How much the driver presses the accelerator pedal, usually expressed as a percentage.

### Brake Pressure
Hydraulic pressure applied during braking; measured per wheel.

### Gearbox / Gear Shifts
Sequential transmission controlled by paddles behind the steering wheel.

---

## Tyres, Suspension & Chassis

### Tyre Compound
Rubber hardness type (Soft/Medium/Hard), affecting grip and degradation.

### Tyre Temperature
Real-time internal and surface temperature for each tyre.

### Tyre Pressure
Air pressure within each tyre; crucial for performance and safety.

### Tyre Wear / Degradation
Loss of grip over time due to rubber breakdown.

### Suspension Travel
Vertical movement of wheels relative to the chassis.

### Ride Height
Distance between the car's floor and the track.

### Aerodynamic Balance
Distribution of downforce between front and rear of the car.

### Downforce
Vertical aerodynamic load pushing the car to the ground for better grip.

---

## Driver Inputs & Controls

### Steering Angle
Measurement of how far the driver turns the steering wheel.

### DRS (Drag Reduction System)
Flap on the rear wing that opens to reduce drag and increase speed on straights.

### Differential Settings
Controls how much the rear wheels can rotate at different speeds during cornering.

### Engine Mode
Driver-selected power unit mode affecting performance, deployment, and fuel efficiency.

### Brake Bias
Percentage distribution of braking force between front and rear wheels.

---

## Positioning, Timing & On-Track Events

### GPS Position
Car's real-time location on the circuit.

### Lap Time
Time taken to complete a full lap.

### Sector Times
Three timed segments that divide each lap.

### Delta Time
Difference between current performance and target/previous lap performance.

### Track Limits
White line boundaries; exceeding them can result in penalties.

### Pit Window
Optimal lap range where a pit stop is most effective for race strategy.

### Overcut / Undercut
Race strategies involving pit stop timing to gain track position.

---

## Weather & Environment

### Ambient Temperature
Air temperature at the circuit.

### Track Temperature
Surface temperature of the racing track.

### Humidity
Moisture percentage in the air, affecting tyre behavior and engine cooling.

### Wind Speed / Direction
Impacts aerodynamic balance and cornering stability.

---

## Race Control & Events

### Race Control
Official body managing race operations, flags, penalties, and safety procedures.

### Flags
Signals for on-track conditions:
- **Green** – Track clear
- **Yellow** – Danger on track, no overtaking
- **Red** – Session/race stopped
- **Blue** – Lapping car approaching
- **Black-and-white** – Warning to a driver
- **Black** – Driver disqualified

### Virtual Safety Car (VSC)
Neutralized race mode requiring drivers to slow to a controlled pace.

### Safety Car (SC)
Physical car deployed to control race pace during dangerous conditions.

### Pit Stop
Visit to the pits for tyre change, repairs, or adjustments.

### Penalties
Time-based or drive-through penalties for infractions (track limits, collisions, unsafe releases).

---

## Sessions & Weekend Structure

### FP1 / FP2 / FP3 (Free Practice)
Practice sessions used for setup, long runs, and telemetry accumulation.

### Qualifying (Q1/Q2/Q3)
Timed sessions determining the starting grid order.

### Race
Main event where championship points are awarded.

### Parc Fermé
Restricted area after qualifying where major changes to the car are prohibited.

---

## Teams, Drivers & Roles

### Team
F1 constructor (e.g., Mercedes, Red Bull) operating two cars.

### Driver
Athlete controlling the car; each has a driver code (e.g., HAM, VER, NOR).

### Race Engineer
Person in constant radio communication with the driver, managing strategy and performance.

### Performance Engineer
Analyzes car and driver telemetry to optimize speed and handling.

### Strategist / Race Strategist
Person deciding when to pit, what tyre to use, and how to react to race events.

---

## Session & Telemetry Categories

### Raw Telemetry
Unprocessed sensor data streamed directly from the car.

### Enriched Telemetry
Raw telemetry combined with context (weather, flags, session info, metadata).

### Car Status Data
Temperature, battery, hydraulic pressure, warnings and reliability metrics.

### Driver Performance Data
Inputs (steering, throttle, braking) and lap time performance metrics.

### Environmental Data
Weather, humidity, wind, track conditions.
