This page shows the Entity-Relationship Diagram generated from the Telemetry API entity classes in the FormulaRaceControlPlatform repository.

<Diagram lang="plantuml" path="formula-telemetry-erd.puml" alt="Formula Telemetry ERD" />

Notes:

- The diagram is sourced from `apps/docs/diagrams/formula-telemetry-erd.puml`.
- The models reference cars via `CarId`/`CarNumber` fields; there are no explicit EF navigation properties or FK annotations in the inspected classes.
